# Next-Level-Nucleo

Developed driver APIs for SPI, I2C, and GPIO communication on the STM32-F401RE Nucleo board, supporting both polling and interrupt-driven methods for efficient data transfer.
Verified the APIs by establishing communication with an Arduino UNO and used semi-hosting and logic analyzer for signal verification.
Designed a clock application using a real-time clock (RTC) module and 7 segment display using the custom I2C driver protocol developed for STM32-F401RE

Look at STM32F401RE_Drivers -> Drivers for the APIs for every communication protocol
Look at STM32F401RE_Drivers -> Src for sample applications using these custom drivers
